Archarodim:
	- Convert a few "errors" into warnings to avoid unnecessary reports
	- Only trigger a "friendly healer under attack" alert if the damage is higher than the 'heal threshold'
	- - Add configuration controls to manage existing 'name to custom marks associations' (view, change, clear) - Fixes and improvement to custom marker UI.
	- Added /hhtd ShowGUI command (in addition to the existing /hhtdg)
	Just so that it appears when typing /hhtd because otherwise people may think there is none... (unless they read the doc)
	- New module: CustomMarks - Allow users to set persistent custom marks on targets (only seen by the user) - (type /HHTDG)
	- Move HHTD healer marker texture reference to a more specific sub-table (plate.HHTD.NPH)
	- Add an option to swap friends and foes symbols
